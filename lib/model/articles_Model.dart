    title: 'The difference between \npain and Suffering',
    content:
        "There is a vast difference between pain and suffering, and this distinction is critical; some level of pain is inevitable in this life, but suffering is avoidable; pain is designed to protect us from deeper harm, and suffering is what happens when we ignore the warning sent by our pain. The challenge today is that we live in a world that does not understand this difference, and we are paying the price. Our modern culture operates as though pain should never exist, as if pain is an oversight of God. A great deal of this false belief comes from the idea that this life is all we have. In a 'YOLO' (you only live once) culture, there will be a demand for this life to be perfect and pain-free. If we did indeed have only one life to live, of course we would demand that life to be perfect. So often, we end up chasing illusions of happiness, believing that if we could only gain the love, approval, power, money, and beauty that we seek, we could fill our emptiness.",

        '“What Did I Do to Deserve This?”',

        "It all started in college. Ahmed couldn’t remember the exact turning point but, little by little, anxiety, anger, and negativity began to overtake his daily life. He struggled to sleep due to his racing heart and mind and also started to feel like getting out of bed each morning was a monumental task. Studying for exams became difficult after his first failing grade and his constant worries about further failures. Nearly every day was filled with dread and anger. He couldn’t understand where all of these feelings were coming from.\nAhmed had looked forward to a career as a pharmacist but, as he continued to struggle in his classes, he gave up on this ambition. He had looked forward to getting married but marriage apps increased his anxiety and frustration levels. Slowly, his goals and dreams began to disappear. Friendships began to deteriorate as his struggles amplified and he complained about everything going on in his life each time he hung out with someone. He found himself getting angry over small things and noticed his friends stopped spending time with him, making him feel even more resentful. He began to miss prayers as he began to feel angry toward Allah for everything he was going through. He had done everything “right”—he had worked hard, prayed, been a good person and a good student—but he was still struggling with uncontrollable emotions. He thought to himself, “It doesn’t matter what I do; I tried my best and I\’m still suffering. What did I do to deserve this?"
        "What is happening to me?"
        "When life takes a turn in a direction we did not anticipate, we suddenly have to reassess our lives and accept a new reality. The dreams we had so tenderly nurtured are suddenly burned to the ground only to be replaced by the scary realization that our lives are not at all what we had pictured.\n\nComing to terms with a new reality involves the loss of a great deal in our lives. Every trauma involves some sort of loss—the loss of something tangible, such as a loved one, a job, a marriage, or one’s health or the loss of something intangible, such as the dream we had once envisioned our lives would look like. No one expects that their pregnancy will end in miscarriage, that a dream job won’t be nearly as fulfilling as anticipated, or that a marriage will end. Once reality hits, it can be difficult to cope.\nWhen difficult situations befall us, it is natural to experience pain and a sense of disappointment, shock, and anger. After all, you likely spent hours imagining what your life would look like only to realize it didn’t pan out in the way you envisioned. This can bring up a variety of difficult thoughts and questions including, “Why do I keep getting hurt?” and “What did I do to deserve this?” and “Is God angry with me?”\n\nWhen these thoughts take hold, they can sometimes result in negative feelings toward Allah (swt). We can never say it is “ok” or “permissible” to internalize anger or ill will toward Allah; however, it is important to know that it is a lot more common than you may think.\n\nAbū Hurayrah narrates that a companion came to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and asked: “We have thoughts which we cannot dare talk about and we do not like that we have them.” The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: “Do you really experience this? Yes, they replied. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: 'They [those concerns] are clear signs of faith.'",

    title: 'Holistic Healing: Islam’s Legacy of Mental Health',
    content:
        "Our attempts to hide from pain through social media often do the opposite, and what this pain-avoidance culture fails to recognize is that even pain itself serves a purpose. Pain is a messenger, often a protective measure, pointing us toward what needs to change in our lives, within ourselves, and in our relationships. It tells us which habits to abandon and which ones to adopt, often demanding that we address hidden wounds needing healing. As Geoff MacDonald, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, put it, “Pain is really good at disrupting attention and getting you singularly focused on making the bad thing stop.” A review of over 500 neuroscience studies found that the pain of heartbreak activates the same brain areas as physical pain. However, just like physical pain, we often try to ignore and numb emotional pain. Years ago, I read an article about a man who went to the dentist with severe tooth pain. The doctor diagnosed an infection causing the pain and prescribed two medications: a painkiller for the throbbing and an antibiotic to treat the infection. The man, unable to afford both, chose the painkiller, successfully numbing his pain, but soon the infection spread to his brain, and he died. The tooth pain was designed to protect him, signaling that something was wrong and needed immediate attention. Instead of addressing the root cause, he numbed the symptom, leading to his death. This mirrors how many of us deal with emotional pain—we don’t address the root cause, only seeking to numb it. As M. Scott Peck writes in *The Road Less Traveled*, “Rather than being the illness, the symptoms are the beginning of its cure. The fact that they are unwanted makes them all the more a phenomenon of grace—a gift of God, a message from the unconscious to initiate self-examination and repair.” Our pain is like a smoke alarm: though we want it to stop, it serves a purpose. We could take out the batteries for momentary peace, but the alarm is there to warn us of a fire. If we ignore it, a spark can burn the whole house down. Many of us suffer because, when we feel emotional or psychological pain, we seek a sedative rather than a cure. We want to 'take the batteries out' of our pain, just to quiet it, rather than searching deeper to find the root cause and address it. This search requires courage and honesty, but it is hard and uncomfortable, so we avoid it. Ironically, this avoidance leads to suffering. Suffering happens when we repeatedly ignore the message of pain. It’s what happened to the man who ignored his tooth pain and did not treat the infection. It’s what happens when we muffle the alarm but allow our house to burn. Sometimes, when we feel empty, our soul is crying out, our heart starving for God, yet we distract ourselves with other things, people, or activities. Emotional and psychological pain, like physical pain, is inevitable. No matter how much we love or try to protect our child, it’s impossible to prevent them from ever falling, feeling pain, or getting hurt. Similarly, sadness, fear, loss, grief, and worry are inevitable in this life.",
